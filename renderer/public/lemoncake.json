    "How could you extract timings from this? - Could assume 3 minutes per step (configurable), plus any specific times mentioned e.g. bake for 30 mins, knead for 15 mins. Maybe 2 minutes per ingredient to weigh it out? Are children helping you?",
    "How many portions does it provide? - could estimate weight of finished item from weight of ingredients, would need to know likely portion size given style of item (i.e. a slice of cake is smaller than a main meal)",
    "Could you derive nutritional information from it? - would have to assume quantity of icing sugar, would need external knowledge of ingredients",
    "Could you extract required techniques from this recipe? - perhaps just a word search on the rendered recipe? 'bake', 'fold', 'stiff peaks' etc."
